## Lab 2 - Data
Creating and importing data interactively is a fast and effective way to prepare data for both prototype and production app development.

1. [Import Data](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/data/import-data/) 

2. [Create a New Dataset](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/data/create-a-new-dataset/)

3. [Explore Layer Data](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/data/explore-layer-data/) 

4. [Query Layers](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/data/query-layers/)

5. [Coding Challenge](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/javascript/create-a-2d-map-with-a-layer/)



## Lab 3 - Design
Learning to create web maps with great cartography is one of the most important steps to building effective mapping applications. Styling maps interactively can also be huge time-saver in app development.

#### Create a Map in either 2D or 3D

Here you can choose to create either a [Web Map in 2D](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/design/create-a-web-map/) or create a [Web Scene in 3D](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/design/create-a-web-scene/). 

#### Style Map

[Start lab](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/design/style-a-web-map/) to learn how to use the Map Viewer to create meaningful visualizations. 

#### Create a Web Map
[Start lab](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/design/create-a-web-map/) to learn how to create a 2D web map that can be used within your own apps. 

#### Configure a Popup

[Start lab](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/design/configure-pop-ups/) to learn how to style popups in the Map Viewer.

#### Style Layers with Smart Mapping 

[Start lab](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/design/style-your-layers-with-smart-mapping/) to learn how to use smart mapping styles to work with multiple layers, perform simple calculations, and display data in meaningful ways.

#### Coding Challenge

* [Start lab](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/javascript/display-a-web-map/) to display your web map using JavaScript. Use the ID from the web map you just created.

## 3. Develop
One of the easiest ways to build an ArcGIS map app is to start with a web map, but you can also use the various
ArcGIS APIs and SDKs to build applications from templates or from scratch.

#### Add a Layer 

[Start lab](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/javascript/create-a-2d-map-with-a-layer/) to add the feature layer to a basemap. Use the feature layer you create above.

#### Add a Web Map

[Start lab](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/javascript/display-a-web-map/) to display your web map using JavaScript. Use the ID from the web map you just created.


#### Coding Challenge

* Calcite Maps ??? (insert jsbin here, yo)

#### EXTRA CREDIT: Working directly with ArcGIS Online REST Services
Understanding how to interact with REST APIs, and ArcGIS Online REST Services in particular, is an important aspect of being a geospatial developer.
Whether you are developing directly against REST Services or simply doing troubleshooting on API, understanding the basics is am important skill.

[Start lab](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/rest/get-an-access-token/) to learn how to programmatically get an access token.

[Start lab](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/rest/get-coordinates-for-an-address/) to learn how to convert an address to a latitude/longitude coordinate.

[Start lab](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/rest/query-a-feature-layer/) to learn how to query a feature layer using the ArcGIS REST API.
* **Challenge** Review the Query capabilities in [REST API documentation](https://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Query_Feature_Service_Layer/02r3000000r1000000/) and research the details of how the various parameters work.

[Start lab](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/rest/add-edit-and-remove-features/) and learn how to add, remove or delete features from a feature service.
