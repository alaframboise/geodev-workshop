## Lab 2 - Data
Creating and importing data interactively is a fast and effective way to prepare data for both prototype and production app development.

1. [Import Data](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/data/import-data/) 

2. [Create a New Dataset](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/data/create-a-new-dataset/)

3. [Explore Layer Data](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/data/explore-layer-data/) 

4. [Query Layers](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/data/query-layers/)

5. Code Challenge: [Create 2D Map with a Layer](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/javascript/create-a-2d-map-with-a-layer/)


## Lab 3 - Design
Learning to create web maps with great cartography is one of the most important steps to building effective mapping applications. Styling maps interactively can also be huge time-saver in app development.

1. Create a[Web Map in 2D](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/design/create-a-web-map/) or create a [Web Scene in 3D](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/design/create-a-web-scene/) 

2. [Style a Web Map](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/design/style-a-web-map/) 

3. [Configure a Popup](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/design/configure-pop-ups/)
 
4. [Style Layers with Smart Mapping](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/design/style-your-layers-with-smart-mapping/)

## Lab 4 - Develop
One of the easiest ways to build an ArcGIS map app is to start with a web map, but you can also use the various
ArcGIS APIs and SDKs to build applications from templates or from scratch.

1. [Add a Layer](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/javascript/create-a-2d-map-with-a-layer/)

2. [Add a Web Map](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/javascript/display-a-web-map/)

3. Query a Feature Layer??

4. Use a Renderer??

5. Coding Challenges
  * Calcite Maps ??? (insert jsbin here, yo)
 
  * Use the ArcGIS REST API to [Query a FeatureLayer](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/rest/query-a-feature-layer/)

  * Use the ArcGIS REST API  to [Add, Edit and Remove Features](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/develop/rest/add-edit-and-remove-features/)
 
  * Review the Query capabilities in [REST API documentation](https://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgis-rest-api/#/Query_Feature_Service_Layer/02r3000000r1000000/) and research the details of how the various parameters work.
